## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

  * **Node.js** (v18 or higher): Essential for running the Angular frontend development environment.
  * **Python** (v3.8 or higher): Required for setting up and running the FastAPI backend.
  * **Git**: For cloning the application repository and managing source code versions.

### Installation and Running the Application

Follow these steps to set up and launch the Task Management Application:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Begin by cloning the project from its GitHub repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:PixieStack/task-management.git
    cd task-management
    ```

    *Note: This project's code is hosted under the **PixieStack** GitHub account.*

2.  **Set up and run the Backend (FastAPI):**
    Navigate to the `backend` directory, install the necessary Python dependencies, and then start the FastAPI server.

    ```bash
    cd backend
    # It's recommended to use a Python virtual environment:
    # python -m venv venv
    # For Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # For macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

    # Install Python dependencies (ensure you have a requirements.txt if needed)
    # pip install -r requirements.txt 

    python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```

    *The backend will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.*

      * **Crucially, the backend must be running for the application's authentication and data features to work.**

3.  **Set up and run the Frontend (Angular):**
    Open a **new terminal window**. Navigate into the `frontend` directory, install its Node.js dependencies, and then launch the Angular development server.

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ng serve --open
    ```

    *The frontend application will compile and automatically open in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:4200`.*

-----

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the application, consider these common troubleshooting steps:

  * **Verify Process Status**: Confirm that both the FastAPI backend and the Angular frontend servers are actively running in their respective terminal windows.
  * **Check Port Availability**: Ensure that ports `8000` (for FastAPI) and `4200` (for Angular) are not in use by other applications on your system. If they are, you might need to adjust the port numbers in the run commands.
  * **Review Backend Path**: If you see "Error loading ASGI app" messages, double-check that the `uvicorn` command correctly points to your FastAPI application (e.g., `app.main:app`).
  * **Inspect JWT Handling**: Issues like "JWT decoding failed" often indicate a mismatch in the `SECRET_KEY` between your backend's configuration and what's used to sign tokens, or an issue with how the frontend sends the token (e.g., missing `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header).
  * **Consult Console Logs**: Always examine the detailed error messages in both your backend and frontend terminal outputs; they are your primary source for diagnosing problems.
  * **Sass Deprecation Warnings**: While not critical errors, the Sass warnings about `lighten()` and `darken()` indicate outdated syntax. For future compatibility, consider updating your SCSS code to use `color.adjust()` or `color.scale()` as suggested by the warnings.
